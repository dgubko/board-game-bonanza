## About The Project

Board Game Bonanza is an intuitive application that displays the top 100 board games retrieved from the Board Game Atlas API. A live search bar can be used to search for specific board games by their titles. Upon selecting a board game, the user is able to peruse the selected board game's details such as its rank, average user rating, number of ratings, description, number of players, playtime, price, and its official site link. At the bottom of each details page, there is a controlled form that allows the user to add or delete their own comments about the selected game. A heart icon for each board game is displayed on the top 100, details, and favorites page. The user can save the specific board game to their favorites or remove it by clicking the heart icon. 

Board Game Bonanza was constructed utilizing React, Router, and Cypress testing. This application allowed our team to showcase our self-taught knowledge of Typescript. On top of learning a new technology we collaborated as a team in a remote setting within a 10 day timeframe. It took us approximately 55 hours total to finish. We used a thought-out DTR, GitHub project board, calendaring, and an Agile workflow to communicate while we balanced the project with our full-time coursework.
