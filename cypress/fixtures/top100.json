Root provides limitless replay value as you and your friends explore the unique factions all wanting to rule a fantastic forest kingdom. Play as the Marquise de Cat and dominate the woods, extracting its riches and policing its inhabitants, as the Woodland Alliance, gathering supporters and coordinate revolts against the ruling regime, the Eyrie Dynasties, regaining control of the woods while keeping your squabbling court at bay, or as the Vagabond, seeking fame and fortune as you forge alliances and rivalries with the other players. Each faction has its own play style and paths to victory, providing an immersive game experience you will want to play again and again.</p>",
    commentary: "<p>During a car ride, designer Cole and his wife were listening to an audio book of T. H. White's <strong>The Once and Future King</strong>. When the Monarch of Moat delivered the following line to Arthur, it spawned a series of ideas creating the framework for Root, a game of Might and Right: &quot;...There is only power. Power is of the individual mind, but the mind's power is not enough. Power of the body decides everything in the end, and only Might is Right.&quot;</p>",
    faq: "<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>
    <p>According to the official rules, your group determines the starting player and seating order randomly (Rule 5.1.1). After the starting player finishes their turn, the next clockwise player begins their turn (Rule 1.5). A common house (unofficial) rule among fans is to have the Marquise (Cat) faction start the game especially at 4 or more player counts.</p>
    <p><strong>Is this a good 2-player game?</strong></p>
    <p>While some may still enjoy the 2-player gameplay (and I am one of them), it's not the ideal player count due to limited number of viable faction combinations. Every faction has an assigned "Reach Value" that represents the amount of influence they can have over the board state, and Leder Games recommends that the total Reach Value should equal or exceed the minimum indicated for the player count (see table below). For example, for 2-player gameplay using the base game, the only viable factions are Marquise and Eyrie.</p>
    <p><img class="w-50" src="https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/userfiles/1613783703105-root%20faction%20reach%20values.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p>If you want to have a fuller experience at a 2-player count, here are some options:</p>
    <ul>

    <p><strong>I have questions about the rules, what should I do?</strong></p>
    <p>Leder Games maintains a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1usz2D3BCurx2nKEOtDseCwNaFL7vOArvGHdrIt_KPio/edit">Google Doc</a> with answers to the most common rules-related questions. If this doesn't help, you can try sharing your question through any of these channels:</p>

    <p><strong>I own a copy of the game but I've heard of balance updates, what should I do?</strong></p>
    <p>Leder Games has offered an update kit containing the minor changes to the boards. You can obtain this kit through one of their Kickstarters for a Root expansion, or print them for free and affix them yourself using this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ErlgQGIQm_T4DFkDKJKiCkuyymZF6hpY/view">PDF</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>How do I know which printing my copy is?</strong></p>
    <p>This is indicated on the back of the box right next to the barcode.</p>

    <p><strong>Is there a way to play this online?</strong></p>
    <p>If you want an experience that closely mimics in-person gameplay, then <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1297678386">Tabletop Simulator has a mod</a> that will allow you and your friends to enjoy Root in a 3D tabletop environment. Otherwise, I'd strongly recommend buying the <a href="https://www.direwolfdigital.com/root/">official digital adaptation</a> created by Dire Wolf Digital.</p>

    description: "<p><em>Scythe</em> gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &quot;Encounter&quot; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br /><br /><em>Scythe</em> uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.<br /><br />Every part of <em>Scythe</em> has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.</p>",

    description_preview: "  Scythe  gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are "Encounter" cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.   Scythe  uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.  Every part of  Scythe  has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times. "
